The runtime ui plugin is intended to handle the UI components for communicating with the Teiid Instance.

This org.teiid.designer.dqp.ui plugin has yet to be fully refactored.

1) Move all com.metamatrix.modeler.dqp.ui classes over to the org.teiid.designer.runtime.ui packages
2) Rename this plugin to org.teiid.designer.runtime.ui
