/**
 * The BaseID class serves as the abstract base class for identifiers of objects. This class provides the method signatures common
 * to all ID classes as well as the majority of the implementation, and defines an identification name as a list of one or more
 * non-zero length atomic name components delimeted by a '.' (similar to JNDI names).
 * <p>
 * Because it is possible and likely that MetaMatrix client applications will construct new instances of identifier classes, these
 * ID concepts in this framework are implemented as classes.
 * <p>
 * These classes are shipped between the client and Configuration Service, so the BaseID class is serializable. To speed
 * serialization and decrease the overhead of shipping BaseID across the network using RMI, several instance variables that may
 * not be required by all users are made transient and recomputed as needed.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, because IDs are designed to be used as primary keys, the <code>hashCode</code>, <code>equals</code> and
 * <code>compareTo</code> methods are all consistent and optimized for fast performance. This is in part accomplished by caching
 * the hash code value, which is tolerable since all BaseID subclasses are <i>immutable</i>: they cannot be modified after they
 * have been created.
 * <p>
 * Finally, several key methods that are very commonly used and that will not be overridden in subclasses are marked as
 * <code>final</code> as an inlining hint to the compiler.
