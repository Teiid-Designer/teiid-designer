/**
 * ModelWorkspaceItem is the base interface for all resource items in the Modeler's
 * Workspace model.  Model workspace items are exposed to clients as handles to the actual underlying element.
 * The model workspace may hand out any number of handles for each element. Handles
 * that refer to the same element are guaranteed to be equal, but not necessarily identical.
 * <p>
 * Methods annotated as "handle-only" do not require underlying elements to exist. 
 * Methods that require underlying elements to exist throw
 * a <code>ModelWorkspaceException</code> when an underlying element is missing.
 * <code>ModelWorkspaceException.isDoesNotExist</code> can be used to recognize
 * this common special case.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
