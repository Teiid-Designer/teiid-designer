Creating a target platform for use in Eclipse Development

The Teiid Designer target platform (TP) is now the JBossTools Integration Stack base target (JBT-IS TP)
and as such is direclty referenced by maven when performing builds.

Developers, on the Teiid Designer project seeking to develop the codebase, should in the target-platform
directory, execute either

 - build.sh
 - build.bat

which will in turn execute maven with the generate-target profile located in the target-platform/pom.xml.
This will create the following:

 - teiid-designer.target

which can be opened in eclipse and set as its target platform.
